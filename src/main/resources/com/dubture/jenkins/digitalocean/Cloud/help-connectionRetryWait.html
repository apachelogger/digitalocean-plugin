<div>
    Seconds to sleep between retrying to connect to a newly created Droplet.
    The longer the sleep, the less requests are needed to provision a new Droplet which may ease API request limit
    exhaustion.
    Shorter sleeping, while potentially causing more requests, reduces the amount of time until the new droplet can be
    used.
